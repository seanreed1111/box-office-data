Joe is diagnosed with an incurable disease, quits his dehumanizing job, and accepts an offer to briefly &amp;quot;live like a king, die like a man&amp;quot; - but to fulfill his agreement he must willingly jump into a live volcano on the island of Waponi Woo in order to appease the volcano god. En route to the island, Joe meets a series of interesting characters in NYC and LA, then boards a yacht, captained by Patricia Graynamore. During the voyage Joe and Patricia survive disaster, fall in love, and finally arrive at the island where they face their destiny." language="English" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA0MTM0ODE2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc5MjMxMDE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="45" imdbRating="5.7" imdbVotes="29,409" imdbID="tt0099892" type="movie"/></root>
