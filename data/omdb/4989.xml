She's taken a job as a tour guide, but she hates it and it shows: the tourists, mostly American, are bored with history and facts; they want to shop. Every group has a goofy couple, a frat boy, a sullen teen, a feuding couple, divorcÃ©es looking for a mate, and a funny guy. This group is no exception, plus there's no air conditioning and a bearded silent driver. Thanks to an unlikely friendship, plus daisies, an ice-cream cone, the history of syrup, and the Oracle at Delphi, Georgia may have a shot at finding her kefi during this four-day tour." language="English, Greek" country="USA, Spain" awards="1 nomination." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE3MzQ2NzczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyNDgzMg@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="34" imdbRating="5.9" imdbVotes="15,988" imdbID="tt0865559" type="movie"/></root>
