After ratings plummet and the show is canceled, we watch a long flashback to see its demise. The studio head gives the show two more weeks. An old friend brings a story about Bigfoot in Ecuador, so a long road trip ensues with stops along the way and enough problems, misjudgments, and deaths to sink a less intrepid band. Peter's team faces competition from a better-funded and more practiced set of rivals. Who will find Bigfoot first, and will they get it on tape and save the show? Can Peter make dad proud?" language="English" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1MTI1OTUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQzMjU1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="12" imdbRating="5.3" imdbVotes="19,223" imdbID="tt0489282" type="movie"/></root>
