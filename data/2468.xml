Returning to their Los Angeles home, the newly &amp;quot;enlightened&amp;quot; couple chastise their closest friends, Ted and Alice, for not coming to grips with their true feelings. Bob insists that everyone &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; rather than intellectualize their emotions, and Carol pronounces &amp;quot;that's beautiful&amp;quot; after anyone says anything even remotely personal. Ted and Alice humor their friends, but it is obvious that there is a good-natured sexual tension at work within the foursome." language="English" country="USA" awards="Nominated for 4 Oscars.
