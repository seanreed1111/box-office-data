Naturally, her parents are searching for a wealthy, well-appointed husband to assure their daughter's future social standing. They are eyeing Mr. Wisley, nephew to the very formidable, not to mention very rich, local aristocrat Lady Gresham, as a prospective match. But when Jane meets the roguish and decidedly non-aristocratic Tom Lefroy, sparks soon fly along with the sharp repartee. His intellect and arrogance raise her ire - then knock her head over heels. Now, the couple, whose flirtation flies in the face of the sense and sensibility of the age, is faced with a terrible dilemma. If they attempt to marry, they will risk everything that matters - family, friends and fortune." language="English" country="UK, Ireland" awards="3 wins &amp; 6 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMjQyMDMxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAwOTM1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="55" imdbRating="7.1" imdbVotes="49,540" imdbID="tt0416508" type="movie"/></root>
