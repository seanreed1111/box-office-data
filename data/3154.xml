Fox, Morris Chestnut, Anthony Anderson, Gabrielle Union" plot="When it comes to matters of the heart, keeping her man happy and committed is all in a day's work for Shanté Smith. Shanté is so adept at navigating the waters of romance that her best girlfriends Diedre, Karen and Tracye depend on her for advice whenever &amp;quot;man trouble&amp;quot; clouds the horizon. But when Shanté's boyfriend Keith is caught red-handed stepping out with a co-worker, Shanté institutes her &amp;quot;Ten Day Plan&amp;quot; to get her man in line. Whether its sexy lingerie or good home cooking, Shanté has an arsenal of weapons designed to bring a man to his knees...and back to her. She's not above playing the damsel in distress or using the ever-reliable local grapevine to get Keith's attention. It's all good, because getting her man back - by any means necessary - is all that matters. Unfortunately the happy ending that Shanté expects goes sideways when Keith begins following the advice of his buddy Tony, who brings a player's perspective to the games girls play. In this comedic battle of the sexes, Shante's about to discover that not only are there no rules - she's not the only one playing. With her relationship at stake and her friends checking her every move, Shanté has to think fast and stay a step ahead of Keith if she has any hope of bringing her man back...with her pride intact." language="English" country="USA" awards="7 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwOTU5MTk2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY5NDIyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="35" imdbRating="6.1" imdbVotes="4,572" imdbID="tt0269341" type="movie"/></root>
