Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as Baby Bink's parents; especially the three enterprising kidnappers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. Successfully kidnapping Baby Bink, they have a harder time keeping hold of the rascal, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than the three bumbling criminals." language="English" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI3NmQ1ZDUtZWQ1My00NzlkLWE5OGQtZjZkYWJmYzYwY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQ2MTMzODA@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="6.0" imdbVotes="35,926" imdbID="tt0109190" type="movie"/></root>
