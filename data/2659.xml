His wife begrudgingly sacrifices domestic comforts, while their darling boy Toby, their daughter Jenny, and their dog Crust have the time of their lives roaming in the wild. Meeting wildlife however has its pros and cons, especially as not all bears are nearly as tame as a local glutton and a pair of cubs in need of adoption. They soon learn to love every moment with family- including old man Boomer and animal friends." language="English" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NDM2MjgzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA4MDYyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="6.4" imdbVotes="1,037" imdbID="tt0072610" type="movie"/></root>
