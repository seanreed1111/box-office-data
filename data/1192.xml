It's a place rigged with hundreds of social landmines, not the least of which are morons, wedgies, swirlies, bullies, lunchtime banishment to the cafeteria floor - and a festering piece of cheese with nuclear cooties. To survive the never-ending ordeal and attain the recognition and status he feels he so richly deserves, Greg devises an endless series of can't-miss schemes, all of which, of course, go awry. And he's getting it all down on paper, via a diary - &amp;quot;it's NOT a diary, it's a journal!&amp;quot; Greg insists, preferring the less-sissyfied designation - filled with his opinions, thoughts, tales of family trials and tribulations, and (would-be) schoolyard triumphs. &amp;quot;One day when I'm famous,&amp;quot; writes Greg, &amp;quot;I'll have better things to do than answer people's stupid questions all day.&amp;quot; So was born the Wimpy Kid's diary." language="English" country="USA, UK" awards="5 wins &amp; 9 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3NzQ2NDgyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc1NzIyMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="56" imdbRating="6.2" imdbVotes="34,665" imdbID="tt1196141" type="movie"/></root>
