The play, &amp;quot;Deathtrap,&amp;quot; is a five character, two act thriller so perfect in its construction that, as Sidney says, &amp;quot;A gifted director couldn't even hurt it.&amp;quot; Using his penchant for plot, and out of his desperate desire to once again be the toast of Broadway, Sidney, along with Myra, cook up an almost unthinkable scheme: They'll lure the would-be playwright to the Bruhl home, kill him, and market the sure-fire script as Sidney's own. But shortly after Clifford arrives, it's clear that things are not what they seem! Indeed, even Helga Ten Dorp, a nosey psychic from next door, and Porter Milgram, Sidney's observant attorney, can only speculate where the line between truth and deception lies." language="English" country="USA" awards="6 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGI5ZjUyNGQtODEwMi00ZmNlLWFjOTQtMWI4ZTQyZTAzZTcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="54" imdbRating="7.0" imdbVotes="9,518" imdbID="tt0083806" type="movie"/></root>
