Throughout the movie the team are subjected to the usual foray of physical abuse from team members or perform hilarious stunts (including some of the more stomach turning stunts such as the Sweat suit cocktail, Toy Train Eruption and Poo Cocktail Supreme - not for the weak stomached!)." language="English" country="USA" awards="1 win &amp; 4 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NTQ1NTE4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEzMzA3NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="56" imdbRating="7.1" imdbVotes="49,763" imdbID="tt1116184" type="movie"/></root>
