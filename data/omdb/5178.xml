He contends that professors from around the United States are being fired from their jobs for promoting, or even exploring the possibility of, intelligent design as an alternative to Darwinism. Stein interviews the expelled academics and other supporters of intelligent design. He also interviews the scientists in the mainstream, who support Darwinism. Stein links Darwinism to Nazism, Communism, eugenics and abortion. Vintage clips of educational films and Hollywood movies are used to illustrate points in a satirical way." language="English" country="USA" awards="2 wins." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0ODIzMDAxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc0MDk2MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="20" imdbRating="3.7" imdbVotes="11,378" imdbID="tt1091617" type="movie"/></root>
