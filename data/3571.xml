On the lam from his latest (unspecified) exploits, he happens upon the town of Jericho, Texas. Actually, calling Jericho a town would be too generous--it has become more like a ghost town, since two warring gangs have 'driven off all the decent folk.' Smith sees this as an opportunity to play both sides off against each other, earning himself a nice piece of change as a hired gun. Despite his strictly avowed mercenary intentions, he finds himself risking his life for his, albeit skewed, sense of honor...." language="English, Spanish" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThkYmJjYTMtOWMzNC00ZjQ4LWI4NzAtYjRlMDA3ZWMyYWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDIyMjczNjI@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="6.4" imdbVotes="46,348" imdbID="tt0116830" type="movie"/></root>
