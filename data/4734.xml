Tired of London and seeking inspiration for her new novel, she accepts an offer from her publisher John Bosload to stay at his home in Luberon, in the South of France. It is the off-season, and Sarah finds that the beautiful country locale and unhurried pace is just the tonic for her--until late one night, when John's indolent and insouciant French daughter Julie unexpectedly arrives. Sarah's prim and steely English reserve is jarred by Julie's reckless, sexually charged lifestyle. Their interactions set off an increasingly unsettling series of events, as Sarah's creative process and a possible real-life murder begin to blend dangerously together." language="English, French" country="France, UK" awards="2 wins &amp; 18 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2Mjg2MTE3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA0MTAwMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="70" imdbRating="6.8" imdbVotes="36,587" imdbID="tt0324133" type="movie"/></root>
