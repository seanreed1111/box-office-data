Malcolm's latest assignment sends him to small-town Georgia, where he's assigned to trap a brutal bank robber (and a recent prison escapee) who they suspect will be coming down to visit his ex-girlfriend Sherry and her son. Malcolm sets up a stakeout across from the home of a larger-than-life southern matriarch known as Big Momma, who's about to be visited by Sherry. It's a simple plan, but there's one big problem: Unbeknownst to Sherry, Big Momma has unexpectedly left town. So Malcolm, decides to impersonate the cantankerous Southern granny. Using a few tricks of disguise, he completely transforms himself into Big Momma, even taking on the corpulent septuagenarian's everyday routine-from cooking soul food to delivering babies to &amp;quot;testifying&amp;quot; at the local church. In the mean time, Malcolm starts falling for Sherry, who may or may not be hiding some stolen cash. Now, Malcolm/Big Momma must somehow find a way to nab his criminal and the girl." language="English" country="USA, Germany" awards="1 win &amp; 8 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMjdlYmUtNjQ1Zi00YTg3LTliNTgtZmNkOTRmYzEzYTMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="33" imdbRating="5.1" imdbVotes="70,492" imdbID="tt0208003" type="movie"/></root>
