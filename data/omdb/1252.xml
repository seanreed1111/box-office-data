Racially divided and economically dying, there is one night that gives the town something to live for: Friday Night. The Permian Panthers have a big winning tradition in Texas high school football, led by QB Mike Winchell and superstar tailback Boobie Miles, but all is not well, as Boobie suffers a career-ending injury in the first game of the season. Hope is lost among citizens in Odessa, and for the team, but Coach Gary Gaines, who believes that &amp;quot;Perfection is being able to look your friends in the eye and know you did everything you could not to let them down&amp;quot;, is somehow able to help the team rise up from the ashes and make a huge season comeback. Now on their way to state, the Panthers must go out and be perfect, because they may never matter this much for the rest of their lives." language="English" country="Germany, USA" awards="2 wins &amp; 5 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxMDI5MTM4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA4MDcyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="70" imdbRating="7.3" imdbVotes="49,814" imdbID="tt0390022" type="movie"/></root>
