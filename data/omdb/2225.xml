Underwater on his mortgage and unclear on what to do with his suddenly free days, Larry heads to his local college to start over. There he becomes part of a colorful community of outcasts, also-rans and the overlooked all trying to find a better future for themselves...often moving around town in a herd of scooters. In his public-speaking class, Larry develops an unexpected crush on his teacher Mercedes Tainot (Roberts), who has lost as much passion for teaching as she has for her husband. The simple guy who has every reason to think his life has stalled will come to learn an unexpected lesson: when you think everything worth having has passed you by, you just might discover your reason to live." language="English" country="USA" awards="3 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1NzAyNTEwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYyNTEzNQ@@._V1._CR68,54,886,1396_SX89_AL_.jpg_V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="41" imdbRating="6.1" imdbVotes="52,764" imdbID="tt1583420" type="movie"/></root>
