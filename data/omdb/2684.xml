What Steve doesn't know is that the crocodile has innocently swallowed a top secret US satellite beacon, and the poachers are actually American special agents sent to retrieve it. Crikey! In the Outback and through the bush with his wife Terri's ever-present commentary ringing out over the countryside (&amp;quot;That was a close one, Steve!&amp;quot;), the Crocodile Hunter is out to save the gorgeous croc and relocate him. It won't be easy, but if he can handle bird-eating spiders and venomous snakes without getting bitten, gun-wielding agents shouldn't be too much of a problem." language="English" country="Australia, USA" awards="1 win &amp; 1 nomination." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA1NTk2Mjc3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzU0NjY2._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="50" imdbRating="5.4" imdbVotes="5,787" imdbID="tt0305396" type="movie"/></root>
