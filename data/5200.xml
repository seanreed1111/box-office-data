Refugees from the future have found a way to return to the past, but the impact of these 'immigrants' on present-day resources has led to the formation of citizen watch groups, who are determined to stop these time-travelers at any cost. Jackson, the teen-aged son of one of these bounty hunters, is enlisted into his first patrol--and is forced into a brutal choice between his father's principles and his own sense of humanity." language="English" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="N/A" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="N/A" imdbVotes="N/A" imdbID="tt3578170" type="movie"/></root>
