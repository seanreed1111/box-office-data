Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful &amp; advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems &amp; is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers &amp; leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?" language="English" country="USA, Germany, UK" awards="3 wins &amp; 21 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5NzM1ODgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA5MjAzMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="66" imdbRating="6.3" imdbVotes="321,485" imdbID="tt0181852" type="movie"/></root>
