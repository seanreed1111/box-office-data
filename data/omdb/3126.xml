But lately the duo's greatest deception is their public friendship, while secretly they've grown to loathe each other. Facing cutthroat competition from guerrilla street magician Steve Gray (Jim Carrey), whose cult following surges with each outrageous stunt, even their show is starting to look stale. But there's still a chance Burt and Anton can save the act - both onstage and off - if only Burt can get back in touch with what made him love magic in the first place." language="English, Spanish" country="USA" awards="1 win &amp; 4 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3MDkxMDAyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY5NzQyOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="44" imdbRating="5.9" imdbVotes="63,137" imdbID="tt0790628" type="movie"/></root>
