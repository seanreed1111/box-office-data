Josie, who was a frustrated, ridiculed nerd, gets a popular make-over from her drop-out, naturally funny brother Rob Geller. Both siblings find love and joys of youth again. But in Josie's case, it's sensitive bachelor teacher Sam Coulson, who enjoys sophisticated conversation. As the publication deadline approaches, the price of blowing their cover seems ever more daunting, yet inevitable unless she sacrifices her career." language="English" country="USA" awards="2 wins &amp; 8 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZmNTUzN2QtYzUxZi00M2YwLTgzNTgtZDkzYjg0YWVmNmYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="60" imdbRating="6.0" imdbVotes="71,366" imdbID="tt0151738" type="movie"/></root>
