The assignment: think of something to change the world and put it into action. Trevor conjures the notion of paying a favor not back, but forward--repaying good deeds not with payback, but with new good deeds done to three new people. Trevor's efforts to make good on his idea bring a revolution not only in the lives of himself, his mother and his physically and emotionally scarred teacher, but in those of an ever-widening circle of people completely unknown to him." language="English" country="USA" awards="1 win &amp; 4 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI3ODI5NDEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDYyMjU3._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="40" imdbRating="7.2" imdbVotes="100,581" imdbID="tt0223897" type="movie"/></root>
