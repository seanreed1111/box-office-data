Desperate for a loan, he accepts to stand in for lawyer friend Jimmy Fleming as coach of a Chicago black 'projects' ghetto Little League baseball team. His sense of pride, becoming the boys' sole idol, and competition, plus their attractive teacher, motivate Conor. But the crushing loan problem rather requires leaving town." language="English, German" country="USA, Germany" awards="2 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY3Nzk0NzkxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNzYxMTE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="48" imdbRating="6.4" imdbVotes="23,689" imdbID="tt0180734" type="movie"/></root>
