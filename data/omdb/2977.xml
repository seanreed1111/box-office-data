His buddies even call him Don Jon because of his ability to pull &amp;quot;10s&amp;quot; every weekend without fail. Yet even the finest flings don't compare to the transcendent bliss he achieves alone in front of the computer watching pornography. Dissatisfied, he embarks on a journey to find a more gratifying sex life, but ends up learning larger lessons of life and love through relationships with two very different women." language="English" country="USA" awards="1 win &amp; 28 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxNTc3NDM2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ5NTQ3OQ@@._V1._CR28,28.649993896484375,1271,1991.0000305175781_SX89_AL_.jpg_V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="66" imdbRating="6.6" imdbVotes="201,114" imdbID="tt2229499" type="movie"/></root>
