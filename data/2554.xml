A chance demonstration of that in prison led to a new friend who helped get him out and into a musical career. With his fire and creative daring, Brown became a star who defiantly created new possibilities in show business both on and behind the stage in face of racism and conventional thinking. Along the way, James would also become a peacemaker who redefined and raised the African-American community's feeling of self-worth when it was needed most. However, those same domineering passions would lead James Brown alienating everyone around him as his appetites became ever more self-destructive. Only after he hit rock bottom with a serious mistake does Brown realize what he needs to do make his life as the Godfather of Soul truly worthwhile." language="English" country="UK, USA" awards="6 wins &amp; 16 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1NjAyMTUzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM4NzQ4MTE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="71" imdbRating="6.9" imdbVotes="17,080" imdbID="tt2473602" type="movie"/></root>
