All Shirley wants is to gather her three adult children around her and share the news as a family.

It's up to Madea, with the help of the equally rambunctious Aunt Bam, to gather the clan together and make things right the only way she knows how: with a lot of tough love, laughter ... and the revelation of a long-buried family secret." language="English" country="USA" awards="1 win &amp; 1 nomination." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1NDQzNDAwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYxNzk0NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="45" imdbRating="4.6" imdbVotes="6,390" imdbID="tt1787759" type="movie"/></root>
