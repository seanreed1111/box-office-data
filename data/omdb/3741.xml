Maddy and her adventurous father have always shared a love for mountain climbing. Their hobby, however, has a disastrous effect when a devastating accident on Mount Everest injures his spine, paralyzing him forever--unless he gets a very expensive operation. Determined to procure the money to pay for his surgery, Maddy decides to recruit two of her friends, a computer genius and a mechanical whiz kid, to help her pull off a risky heist. They plan to break into the local super-high-tech bank, which holds a vault suspended 100 feet off the floor, and get to its safe. To complicate matters even further, Maddy's mother works as the security chief at that very bank. Regardless of what obstacles she faces, Maddy is determined to get to the funds her father needs, by using the amazing climbing skills he taught her." language="English" country="USA, Germany" awards="1 nomination." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcwMzMxNjUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTY4MjY2._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="33" imdbRating="5.2" imdbVotes="8,399" imdbID="tt0337917" type="movie"/></root>
