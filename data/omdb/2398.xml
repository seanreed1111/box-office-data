His dream comes within reach when clever nerd Wade, has fat friend Ryan 'T-dog' and cocky shrimp Jim, all new to high-school, are bullied so badly by emancipated Filkins and his buddies that they advertise for a bodyguard. Only Drillbit seems affordable and not crazy, so he's hired and drains their pocket-money and home content. He's clueless how to protect them but gives them (bogus) self-defense classes." language="English" country="USA" awards="1 win &amp; 2 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxNzkwOTc3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc1MzU1MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="41" imdbRating="5.7" imdbVotes="52,076" imdbID="tt0817538" type="movie"/></root>
