He's an artful dodger, so Martine, a former model with a thing for him, brings him her scheme: a bank's alarm is off for a couple weeks, so let's tunnel into the vault. He assembles a team, not realizing her real goal is a safe-deposit box with compromising photos of a royal: she needs the photos to trade for avoiding a jail sentence - and MI-5, or is it MI-6, is pulling the strings two steps removed. A Trinidadian thug, a high-end bordello owner, and a pornographer also have things stored in the vault, so the break-in threatens many a powerful personage. Is there any way these amateurs can pull it off?" language="English, Latin" country="UK, USA, Australia" awards="2 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzc1MDMxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY4OTIzMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="69" imdbRating="7.3" imdbVotes="157,618" imdbID="tt0200465" type="movie"/></root>
