Sonny has his eye on a promising property now that his first venture, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful, has only a single remaining vacancy - posing a rooming predicament for fresh arrivals Guy (Richard Gere) and Lavinia (Tamsin Greig). Evelyn and Douglas (Judi Dench and Bill Nighy) have now joined the Jaipur workforce, and are wondering where their regular dates for Chilla pancakes will lead, while Norman and Carol (Ronald Pickup and Diana Hardcastle) are negotiating the tricky waters of an exclusive relationship, as Madge (Celia Imrie) juggles two eligible and very wealthy suitors. Perhaps the only one who may know the answers is newly installed co-manager of the hotel, Muriel (Maggie Smith), the keeper of everyone's secrets. As the demands of a traditional Indian wedding threaten to engulf them all, an unexpected way forward presents itself." language="English" country="UK, USA" awards="1 nomination." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MjkxNjc0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjc0NDg0NDE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="51" imdbRating="6.6" imdbVotes="25,272" imdbID="tt2555736" type="movie"/></root>
