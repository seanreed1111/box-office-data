Cook, David Denman, Caroline Dhavernas" plot="Bull Mountain, Alaska, is a no frills ski resort, and the staff is a bunch of partying snowboard bums. The late founder, Papa Muntz, was famed for skiing with his backside exposed, and in fact is so memorialized by a statue. But his son, Ted, plans to sell the resort to hotshot ski mogul John Majors, who starts turning it into a slick resort, which of course has no room for most of the staff. The exception is Rick, the most serious of the bunch. But there's a complication: Rick met Majors' stepdaughter Anna on vacation in Mexico, and he's never gotten over a crush he had on her, even though she's about to marry a great guy. And Rick is also fiercely loyal to his friends." language="English" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NTczOTE2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzcyNTQyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="22" imdbRating="6.3" imdbVotes="15,039" imdbID="tt0253798" type="movie"/></root>
