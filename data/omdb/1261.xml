White, Dean Cain" plot="Freshman university student Josh Wheaton attends a philosophy class, where the uncompromising Professor Radisson requires all students to submit a signed statement that the &amp;quot;God is dead&amp;quot; and never existed. When Josh refuses due to his own Christian beliefs, the Professor challenges him to defend his position that his god, Yahweh, is real, leading to a series of confrontational presentations between himself and the professor, with the class as jury. Josh's plans to go to law school depend on not failing this class. Josh's girlfriend urges him not to throw away his future with this pointless act of defiance. At the same time, Pastor Dave and African missionary Jude attempt to leave town on a trip, but are hindered by comical accidents. Student Ayisha is at odds with her father's conservative religious principles. Businessman Mark acts cynically towards his mentally ill mother, while his journalist girlfriend receives bad news from a doctor." language="English" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwNDQ3MzYyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE0ODM3MDE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="16" imdbRating="4.9" imdbVotes="34,246" imdbID="tt2528814" type="movie"/></root>
