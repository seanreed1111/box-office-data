Kirk is an instructor at Starfleet Academy and feeling old; the prospect of attending his ship, the USS Enterprise--now a training ship--on a two-week cadet cruise does not make him feel any younger. But the training cruise becomes a deadly serious mission when his nemesis Khan Noonien Singh--infamous conqueror from late 20th century Earth--appears after years of exile. Khan later revealed that the planet Ceti Alpha VI exploded, and shifted the orbit of the fifth planet as a Mars-like haven. He begins capturing Project Genesis, a top secret device holding the power of creation itself, and schemes the utter destruction of Kirk." language="English" country="USA" awards="3 wins &amp; 9 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzcyYWE5YmQtNDE1Yi00ZjlmLWFlZTAtMzRjODBiYjM3OTA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="71" imdbRating="7.7" imdbVotes="96,387" imdbID="tt0084726" type="movie"/></root>
