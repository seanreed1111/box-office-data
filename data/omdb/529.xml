Reckless test pilot Hal Jordan acquires superhuman powers when he is chosen by the Ring, the willpower-fed source of power. Reluctantly at first, he takes on the challenge after the death of Abin Sur, the finest Green Lantern. Putting his self-doubts aside, and spurred on by his sense of duty and love for his beautiful, intellectually equal, colleague, Carol Ferris, he is soon called to defend mankind from Parallax, a powerful, evil being who feeds on fear. Hal Jordan is the universe's last chance, as many Green Lanterns have been killed and the Corps is weakened. And he might just be the right Green Lantern for the duty of keeping the world safe from harm." language="English" country="USA" awards="3 wins &amp; 6 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyMTg3OTM5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMjEyNQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="39" imdbRating="5.6" imdbVotes="233,624" imdbID="tt1133985" type="movie"/></root>
