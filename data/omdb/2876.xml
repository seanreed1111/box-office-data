As Bob the Tomato and the kids settle in to wait for a tow truck to help get their van back on the road, the &amp;quot;Pirates Who Don't Do Anything&amp;quot; share a little story about a guy named Jonah. Jonah was kind of like a mailman except his messages came straight from God. Jonah loves his job, until the day comes when he has to deliver a message to the people of Nineveh. Instead of carrying out his mission, Jonah turns and sets sail in the opposite direction onboard a pirate ship. Soon Jonah embarks on an adventure that leads him into the belly of a whale, and to the heart of Nineveh for a hilarious showdown." language="English" country="USA, UK" awards="2 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0OTk5MTk0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTgxMDg5._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="58" imdbRating="6.6" imdbVotes="3,277" imdbID="tt0298388" type="movie"/></root>
