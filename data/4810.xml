Schwartzwalder recruits Davis with the help of All-American running back, Jim Brown. The civil rights movement is gaining steam; Davis experiences prejudice on campus, in town, and on the field, sometimes from teammates. How he handles it and how he challenges Schwartzwalder to stand up for his players provide a counterpoint to several great seasons that lead first to a national championship and then to the Heismann Trophy." language="English" country="USA, Germany" awards="1 win &amp; 3 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MTY5OTA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA5ODk3MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="58" imdbRating="7.3" imdbVotes="17,330" imdbID="tt0469903" type="movie"/></root>
