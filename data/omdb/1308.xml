Young Cody is determined to win the most important competition in the world of penguin surfing in honor of &amp;quot;Big Z,&amp;quot; a deceased surfing legend whom he has idolized since childhood. But the waves in Pen Gu are different than in Shiverpool, and the competition is steep. The current champ, egotistical Tank Evans, isn't just about to let this little penguin knock him from first place without a fight. When Cody wipes out and encounters Geek, a recluse aging former surfer, living in the jungle, he learns some important lessons about life and surfing, and even teaches Geek a thing or two." language="English" country="USA" awards="Nominated for 1 Oscar.
