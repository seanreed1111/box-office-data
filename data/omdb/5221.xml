The film's attempted biography matches many public myths surrounding Cole at the time, despite its lack of relationship with truth. For instance, truth and movie are different in regards to: his sex life (he was a gay man in a marriage of convenience with a divorcee friend), his relationship with his wife, Monty Wooley was a contemporary (not Professor), and his French military experience was a hoax." language="English" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3MTY5NzUtMjJiYS00MDNlLThjZGYtNmVkYzU5NTA1N2U4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="6.2" imdbVotes="2,185" imdbID="tt0038776" type="movie"/></root>
