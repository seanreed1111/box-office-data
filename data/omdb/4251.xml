Muslims, Jews and Christians of many kinds pass before his jaundiced eye. Maher goes to a Creationist Museum in Kentucky, which shows that dinosaurs and people lived at the same time 5000 years ago. He talks to truckers at a Truckers' Chapel. (Sign outside: &amp;quot;Jesus love you.&amp;quot;) He goes to a theme park called Holy Land in Florida. He speaks to a rabbi in league with Holocaust deniers. He talks to a Muslim musician who preaches hatred of Jews. Maher finds the unlikeliest of believers and, in a certain Vatican priest, he even finds an unlikely skeptic." language="English, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Spanish" country="USA" awards="2 wins &amp; 1 nomination." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxMDcxMTA3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk5NzU2MQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="56" imdbRating="7.7" imdbVotes="54,138" imdbID="tt0815241" type="movie"/></root>
