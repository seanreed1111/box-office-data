After dominating British politics for years, Lang has retired with his wife to the USA. He lives on an island, in luxurious, isolated premises complete with a security detail and a secretarial staff. Soon, Adam Lang gets embroiled in a major scandal with international ramifications that reveals how far he was ready to go in order to nurture UK's &amp;quot;special relationship&amp;quot; with the USA. But before this controversy has started, before even he has closed the deal with the publisher, the ghost-writer gets unmistakable signs that the turgid draft he is tasked to put into shape inexplicably constitutes highly sensitive material." language="English" country="France, Germany, UK" awards="34 wins &amp; 54 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3NzMwMzkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk4NjQxMw@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="77" imdbRating="7.2" imdbVotes="138,919" imdbID="tt1139328" type="movie"/></root>
