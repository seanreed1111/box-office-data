Everything seems to be changing for the better at Hotel Transylvania... Dracula's rigid monster-only hotel policy has finally relaxed, opening up its doors to human guests. But behind closed coffins, Drac is worried that his adorable half-human, half-vampire grandson, Dennis, isn't showing signs of being a vampire. So while Mavis is busy visiting her human in-laws with Johnny - and in for a major cultural shock of her own - &amp;quot;Vampa&amp;quot; Drac enlists his friends Frank, Murray, Wayne and Griffin to put Dennis through a &amp;quot;monster-in-training&amp;quot; boot camp. But little do they know that Drac's grumpy and very old, old, old school dad Vlad is about to pay a family visit to the hotel. And when Vlad finds out that his great-grandson is not a pure blood - and humans are now welcome at Hotel Transylvania - things are going to get batty!" language="English" country="USA" awards="1 win &amp; 10 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzNzc4NzEyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAxMDQ2NTE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="44" imdbRating="6.7" imdbVotes="70,706" imdbID="tt2510894" type="movie"/></root>
