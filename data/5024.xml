They thrive on the no-room-for-error, fast-paced job and let it infect their lives. The undisputed king of pushing tin, &amp;quot;The Zone&amp;quot; Falzone, rules his workplace and his wedded life with the same short-attention span that gets planes where they need to be in the nick of time. That is, until Russell Bell, a new transfer with a reputation for recklessness but a record of pure perfection shatters the tensely-held status quo. The game of one-upmanship between the two flies so high as to lead Nick into Russell's bed with his wife. His sanity slipping just as fast as his hold on #1, Cusack's controller is thrown out-of-control when Thornton's wanderer quietly leaves town. Nick must now find a way to regain his sanity and repair his marriage before he breaks down completely." language="English, French" country="USA, Germany" awards="2 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWNiMDdmNzUtOWE0MC00MjViLTkyOTctYTI0ZmUzOTU4ZTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="47" imdbRating="6.0" imdbVotes="25,465" imdbID="tt0120797" type="movie"/></root>
