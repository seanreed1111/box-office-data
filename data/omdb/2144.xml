They are Jewish and Catholic respectively. They would grow up and become a rabbi and priest. Anna, whom they knew when they were younger, comes back to town a stunning woman. Jake is up to be the head of his synagogue but he is not married which doesn't make his appointment any easier. Jake finds himself attracted to Anna but because she's not Jewish, he can't marry her as it would make his appointment less likely. Brian also finds himself attracted to Anna, but the priesthood doesn't allow that. Their friendship is strained when each learns of the other's feelings for her." language="English, Hebrew, Spanish" country="USA" awards="2 wins &amp; 5 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMxNzg3MzQ3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTY4Nzc5._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="60" imdbRating="6.4" imdbVotes="45,993" imdbID="tt0171433" type="movie"/></root>
