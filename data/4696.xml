Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the spacecraft's shocking, deadly secrets are revealed...and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined." language="English, Vietnamese, German" country="Germany, UK" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQxNjc5NTMxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg2NDE4Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="28" imdbRating="6.8" imdbVotes="127,742" imdbID="tt1188729" type="movie"/></root>
