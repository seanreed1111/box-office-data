Gene Hackman plays the brilliant leader of a gang (Delroy Lindo, Ricky Jay &amp; Rebecca Pigeon as Hackman's youngish wife), which pulls off complex heists for a despicable fence (Danny DeVito). After stiffing the gang on a jewelry robbery, DeVito forces the gang to go after a Swiss gold shipment and to use his nephew (Sam Rockwell) in the crime. No one trusts anyone and every step is shaded with the unexpected." language="English" country="Canada, USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBiNTNlZTMtZjlmNC00ZGI0LWI2YjctODA4MzNlYjEyNzQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk3NzU2MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="66" imdbRating="6.5" imdbVotes="28,863" imdbID="tt0252503" type="movie"/></root>
