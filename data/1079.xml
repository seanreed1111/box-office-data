One night he surprises an intruder (Spencer Breslin), who turns out to be a kid, almost 8 years old. There's something oddly familiar about the chubby lad, whose name is Rusty. The boy's identity sparks a journey into Russ's past that the two of them take - to find the key moment that has defined who Russ is. Two long-suffering women look on with disbelief: Russ's secretary, Janet(Lily Tomlin), and his assistant, the lovely Amy, to whom Rusty takes a shine. What, and who, is at the end of this journey?" language="English" country="USA" awards="1 win &amp; 2 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMzk2NTE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTcyOTAwMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="45" imdbRating="6.1" imdbVotes="35,812" imdbID="tt0219854" type="movie"/></root>
