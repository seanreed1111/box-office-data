Jobless, and with no savings, pension, or home equity, Dick and his wife Jane sink slowly into poverty. He looks for work (as do all former Globodyne executives); he even tries day labor with the relatives of their Mexican nanny. A foreclosure notice sends Dick and Jane over the edge into a life of blue-collar crime. Then, as things finally look up, the report of an looming indictment pushes Dick and Jane toward a denouement with the real criminals, the white-collar guys." language="English, Spanish" country="USA" awards="7 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTJiMWFiNzgtMDQxZi00NTFiLWE2YjMtNTA5NzY5YzQxZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="47" imdbRating="6.1" imdbVotes="115,667" imdbID="tt0369441" type="movie"/></root>
