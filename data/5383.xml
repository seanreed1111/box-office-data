A high school senior, charming and self-possessed, he's the life of the party, loves his job at a men's clothing store, and has no plans for the future. A budding alcoholic, he's never far from his supersized, whiskey-fortified thirst-master cup. But after being dumped by his girlfriend, Sutter gets drunk and wakes up on a lawn with Aimee Finecky hovering over him. She's different: the &amp;quot;nice girl&amp;quot; who reads science fiction and doesn't have a boyfriend. While Aimee has dreams of a future, Sutter lives in the impressive delusion of a spectacular now, yet somehow, they're drawn together." language="English" country="USA" awards="10 wins &amp; 31 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MTc0NTkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEwNjE3OQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="82" imdbRating="7.1" imdbVotes="117,003" imdbID="tt1714206" type="movie"/></root>
