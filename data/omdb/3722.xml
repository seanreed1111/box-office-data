While providing breathtaking views of skydiving over the Florida Keys, the Mojave Desert and in the magnificent Fjords of Norway, this giant-screen experience explores the psychological and physiological forces behind risk-taking, and the physics involved in these activities. In doing so, it also shows us how risk-taking is part of everyday life. The storyline focuses on two risk-takers, Adrian Nicholas and Katarina Ollikainen. Nicholas, a veteran skydiver who has performed thousands of jumps, is the record holder for the longest unassisted human flight, a 4-minute 55-second flight at speeds of up to 200 kilometers/hour that took place in 1999. Adrenaline Rush even allows spectators to directly experience a base jump thanks to a camera strapped to one of the professional jumpers who took part in the film. You can live through a 1300-meter (4150 feet) jump from a legendary cliff in Norway, the Katthammaren Wall." language="English" country="Canada" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NDY4MjgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc4MzcyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="7.3" imdbVotes="224" imdbID="tt0353164" type="movie"/></root>
