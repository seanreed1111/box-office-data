When Frank's father (Ray Stevenson) pays him a visit in the south of France, their father-son bonding weekend takes a turn for the worse when Frank is engaged by a cunning femme-fatale, Anna (Loan Chabanol), and her three seductive sidekicks to orchestrate the bank heist of the century. Frank must use his covert expertise and knowledge of fast cars, fast driving and fast women to outrun a sinister Russian kingpin, and worse than that, he is thrust into a dangerous game of chess with a team of gorgeous women out for revenge. From the producers of LUCY and the TAKEN trilogy, THE TRANSPORTER REFUELED is a fresh personification of the iconic role of Frank Martin, that launches the high-octane franchise into the present-day and introduces it to the next generation of thrill-seekers." language="English, Russian, French" country="France, China, Belgium" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMDE2ODU3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU0MTA0NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="32" imdbRating="5.1" imdbVotes="31,234" imdbID="tt2938956" type="movie"/></root>
