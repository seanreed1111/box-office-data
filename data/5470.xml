Later, he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, inadvertently interrupting an assassination by a feared Ninja-cult. As he is now the only man to have seen the face of the cult's warrior-leader and lived, he soon realizes that he is facing a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy. Teaming up with a friendly samurai couple, on a two-centuries-old blood-feud with the Ninja, he struggles to survive. Finally, recuperating on an island-fortress, he learns swordsmanship, and perhaps, a little about courage, honor, love, and loyalty. The requisite final confrontation is rife with bloody swordplay and spectacular martial-arts action sequences." language="English, Japanese" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI4MjA5Nzg1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU5ODEyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="5.9" imdbVotes="3,943" imdbID="tt0113360" type="movie"/></root>
