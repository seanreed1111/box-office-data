We see underwater swimmers representing this. He is young, in a jungle setting, with two fanciful &amp;quot;instincts&amp;quot; guiding him as swooping bird-like acrobats initially menace, then delight. As an adolescent, he enters a desert, where a man spins a large cube of metal tubing. He leaves his instinct-guides behind, and enters a garden where two statues dance in a pond. As he watches their sensual acrobatics of love, he becomes a man. He is offered wealth (represented by a golden hat) by a devil figure. In a richly decorated room, a scruffy troupe of a dozen acrobats and a little girl reawaken the old man's youthful nature and love." language="English" country="Canada" awards="1 win." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwNzI3NjM2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEyNTMyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="55" imdbRating="7.0" imdbVotes="591" imdbID="tt0213749" type="movie"/></root>
