Clueless nightclub waitress Sunny Ann Davis accidentally spots and stops a terrorist shooting at the president and his royal guest. Her naive comments charm the press, so the State Department recruits her for its Protocol. She falls in love with charming Middle East desk chief Michael Ransome, who resigns rather than help trick her into a 'contact mission' to Othar, where the emir's plan with her unexpectedly stirs a revolution." language="English" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzZWVkNTgtMmRiZS00MjYzLWFhNDItZTkyNGU5M2Q5MjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="5.4" imdbVotes="3,737" imdbID="tt0087951" type="movie"/></root>
