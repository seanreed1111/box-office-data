Bernard is a selfish, cheap and jealous decadent writer that rationalizes every attitude in his family and life and does not accept &amp;quot;philistines&amp;quot; - people that do not read books or watch movies, while the unfaithful Joan is growing as a writer and has no problems with &amp;quot;philistines&amp;quot;. Their sons, the teenager Walt and the boy Frank, feel the separation and take side: Walt stays with Bernard, and Frank with Joan, and both are affected with abnormal behaviors. Frank drinks booze and smears with sperm the books in the library and a locker in the dress room of his school. The messed-up and insecure Walt uses Roger Water's song &amp;quot;Hey You&amp;quot; in a festival as if it was of his own, and breaks up with his girlfriend Sophie.
