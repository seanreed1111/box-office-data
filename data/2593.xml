However, top-secret US government agent 'Bob' arranges a staged death, so Maggie can be elaborately trained as a killer. She gets a new cover identity as saleswoman Claudia Anne Doran. She also finds a house-mate, building super J.P., a broad-minded, gentle photographer. The two fall in love, and that complicates her government assignments. His influence extends to breeding in her a conscience that supplants her violent tendencies and desire to continue work for the agency." language="English, French" country="USA" awards="N/A" poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwY2I3YmEtYWI1Ny00MjQyLThiNDUtZWI2NTI5YjJjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="N/A" imdbRating="6.0" imdbVotes="21,457" imdbID="tt0107843" type="movie"/></root>
