Shortly after her arrival, a local preacher, Cort, is thrown through the saloon doors while townfolk are signing up for a gun competition. The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule: that you follow the rules of the man that set up the contest, Herod. Herod is also the owner, leader, and &amp;quot;ruler&amp;quot; of the town. Seems he's arranged this little gun-show-off so that the preacher (who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod) will have to fight again. Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod, acknowledging Cort as one of the best, is determined to alter this line of thinking ... even if it gets someone killed ..." language="English, Spanish" country="Japan, USA" awards="1 nomination." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI2ZTZmMmItMmM3YS00ZjUwLWJiODMtMmRjMWM4NDE0OWFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="49" imdbRating="6.4" imdbVotes="72,614" imdbID="tt0114214" type="movie"/></root>
