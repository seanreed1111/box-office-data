To this end, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, an Army officer convinced he must save Germany from Hitler, is recruited to mastermind a real plan. To do so, he arranges for the internal emergency measure, Operation: Valkyrie, to be changed to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the assassination of the Fuhrer. However, even as the plan is put into action, a combination of bad luck and human failings conspire on their own to create a tragedy that would prolong the greater one gripping Europe." language="English, German" country="USA, Germany" awards="2 wins &amp; 11 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3Njc2ODEyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAwMzc3NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="56" imdbRating="7.1" imdbVotes="194,532" imdbID="tt0985699" type="movie"/></root>
