With a new boy arriving every thirty days, the group has been in &amp;quot;The Glade&amp;quot; for three years, trying to find a way to escape through the Maze that surrounds their living space (patrolled by cyborg monsters named 'Grievers'). They have begun to give up hope when a comatose girl arrives with a strange note, and their world begins to change with the boys dividing into two factions: those willing to risk their lives to escape and those wanting to hang onto what they've got and survive." language="English" country="USA, UK" awards="4 wins &amp; 10 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUyNTA3MTAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEyMTkyMjE@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="57" imdbRating="6.8" imdbVotes="338,325" imdbID="tt1790864" type="movie"/></root>
