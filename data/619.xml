With no job possibilities on the horizon, the two dads open their own day care facility, &amp;quot;Daddy Day Care&amp;quot;, and employ some fairly unconventional and sidesplitting methods of caring for children. As &amp;quot;Daddy Day Care&amp;quot; starts to catch on, it launches them into a highly comedic rivalry with Chapman Academy's tough-as-nails director... who has driven all previous competitors out of business." language="English, Klingon, German" country="USA" awards="1 win &amp; 6 nominations." poster="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTZiYjEzY2UtMzA2OC00NjM1LWFlMjItMzg4MTAwOTU2YzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg" metascore="39" imdbRating="5.5" imdbVotes="52,693" imdbID="tt0317303" type="movie"/></root>
